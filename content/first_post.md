Summary: This is a summary of the first post written for our Pelican Blog. We're using this for the 100days of Web course.

##Big Heading for a big day!

This is the first paragraph of our article - huzzah!

We're writing this in Markdown format so we can use two * symbols to indicate a **bold** formatted block of text.

###A slightly smaller header...

We can also use a single * around a block of text to indicate an *italicized* word.


###Let's throw an image in here

THE END! (Cool story bro!)
